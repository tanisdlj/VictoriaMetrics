summary: The Simple & Reliable Logs Solution That Scales
description: |
  VictoriaLogs is log management and log analytics system from VictoriaMetrics.
  * It provides the following key features:
    * VictoriaLogs can accept logs from popular log collectors. See https://docs.victoriametrics.com/VictoriaLogs/data-ingestion.
    * VictoriaLogs is much easier to setup and operate comparing to ElasticSearch and Grafana Loki. See https://docs.victoriametrics.com/VictoriaLogs/QuickStart.html.
    * VictoriaLogs provides easy yet powerful query language with full-text search capabilities across all the log fields - see https://docs.victoriametrics.com/VictoriaLogs/LogsQL.html.
    * VictoriaLogs can be seamlessly combined with good old Unix tools for log analysis such as grep, less, sort, jq, etc. See https://docs.victoriametrics.com/VictoriaLogs/querying/#command-line for details.
    * VictoriaLogs capacity and performance scales linearly with the available resources (CPU, RAM, disk IO, disk space). It runs smoothly on both Raspberry PI and a server with hundreds of CPU cores and terabytes of RAM.
    * VictoriaLogs can handle much bigger data volumes than ElasticSearch and Grafana Loki when running on comparable hardware. See https://docs.victoriametrics.com/VictoriaLogs/#benchmarks.
    * VictoriaLogs supports multitenancy - see https://docs.victoriametrics.com/VictoriaLogs/#multitenancy.
    * VictoriaLogs supports out of order logs' ingestion aka backfilling.
    * VictoriaLogs provides simple web UI for querying logs - see https://docs.victoriametrics.com/VictoriaLogs/querying/#web-ui.
