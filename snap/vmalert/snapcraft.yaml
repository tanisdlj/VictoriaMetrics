summary: executes a list of given alerting or recording rules
description: |
  For sending alerting notifications *vmalert** relies on **Alertmanager** configured via `-notifier.url` flag. 
  Recording rules results are persisted via remote write protocol and require `-remoteWrite.url` to be configured.
  vmalert is heavily inspired by **Prometheus** implementation and aims to be compatible with its syntax.

  A single-node or cluster version of **VictoriaMetrics** are capable of proxying requests to vmalert via `-vmalert.proxyURL` command-line flag. 
  Use this feature for the following cases:
  * for proxying requests from **Grafana Alerting UI**;
  * for accessing vmalerts **UI** through **VictoriaMetrics Web** interface.
  * Integration with VictoriaMetrics TSDB;
  * VictoriaMetrics MetricsQL support and expressions validation;
  * Prometheus alerting rules definition format support;
  * Integration with Alertmanager starting from Alertmanager v0.16.0-alpha;
  * Keeps the alerts state on restarts;
  * Graphite datasource can be used for alerting and recording rules. See these docs;
  * Recording and Alerting rules backfilling (aka replay). See these docs;
  * Lightweight and without extra dependencies.
  * Supports reusable templates for annotations;
  * Load of recording and alerting rules from local filesystem, URL, GCS and S3;
  * Detect alerting rules which don't match any series.
